          <Section title="1. Payment and Booking Confirmation">
            Payments are processed securely through Stripe. Once payment is completed, your booking request is submitted to SoHo Cleaning Group for scheduling and review.
          </Section>

          <Section title="2. Cancellations">

          <Section title="3. Refund Eligibility">
            Refunds may be considered if a service cannot be fulfilled by SoHo Cleaning Group, if a duplicate payment occurs, or if cancellation is approved before service preparation has begun.
          </Section>

          <Section title="4. Non-Refundable Situations">
            Refunds may not be available for missed appointments, inability to access the property, inaccurate booking details, same-day cancellations, or services already completed.
          </Section>

          <Section title="5. Processing Time">
            Approved refunds will be processed back to the original payment method. Processing times may vary depending on Stripe and the customer’s bank or card provider.
