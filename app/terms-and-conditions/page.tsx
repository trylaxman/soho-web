          <Section title="1. Services">
            SoHo Cleaning Group provides residential cleaning services in
            Manhattan. Service scope may vary based on the cleaning type,
            property condition, selected add-ons, and booking details.
          </Section>

          <Section title="2. Bookings">
            Customers are responsible for providing accurate booking details,
            including address, home size, access instructions, preferred date,
            time slot, and any special notes.
          </Section>

          <Section title="3. Payments">
            Payments are processed securely through Stripe. A booking is only
            submitted after successful payment. Pricing may vary based on
            service type, home size, square footage, and requested services.
          </Section>

          <Section title="4. Access to Property">
            Customers must ensure safe and timely access to the property. If our
            cleaning team is unable to access the property within 20 minutes of
            arrival due to missing keys, no response, building restrictions,
            doorman issues, elevator delays, or other access-related issues, a
            lockout fee or cancellation fee may apply. If our team is already en
            route or onsite and access cannot be provided, the full booking
            amount is non-refundable.
          </Section>

          <Section title="5. Service Limitations">
            We provide residential cleaning services only. We do not perform
            remediation, restoration, biohazard cleanup, pest-related cleanup,
            exterior window cleaning, heavy lifting, unsafe ladder work,
            appliance repair, plumbing, electrical work, or hazardous-material
            handling.
          </Section>

          <Section title="6. Heavy Soil or Extreme Conditions">
            Pricing assumes normal residential conditions. Excessive buildup,
            clutter, heavy soil, post-construction debris, or unsafe conditions
            may require additional charges or service refusal.
          </Section>

          <Section title="7. Pets">
            Customers must disclose whether pets are present in the home. Pets
            should be safely secured during the cleaning visit for the safety of
            both the cleaning professional and the pet.

            service may be cancelled with no fee. Cancellations made 24 to 48
            hours before service may be subject to a 25% fee. Cancellations made
            less than 24 hours before service may be subject to a 50% fee.
            Same-day cancellations, no-shows, or lockouts may be charged the
            full booking amount.
          </Section>
